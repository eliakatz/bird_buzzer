Bird classification with ML

The project classify the birds by their sound, in order to decide whether to drive them away (dove, crow, myna) or not (sunbird).

It converts mp3 files to wav for processing.

The audio files were downloaded from www.xeno-canto.org.

The next stage is to activate a buzzer through Arduino or Raspberry PI.

The mp3 files are located in the zipped folders.
